      content: 'The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4] A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6]',

      content: 'The domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris)[4] is a domesticated form of wolf. The dog descended from an ancient, extinct wolf,[5][6] with the modern grey wolf being the dog\'s nearest living relative.[7] The dog was the first species to be domesticated[8][7] by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago,[6] before the development of agriculture.[1] Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior,[9] enabling an abundant cosmopolitan distribution[10] and the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[11]',
